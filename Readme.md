# How to initialize appointment images and display text using the custom field values


<p>Starting with version 15.2, weÂ split layout calculation operations into several threads to improve the typical performance of a Scheduling application. Correspondingly, in a common scenario,Â theÂ <strong>InitAppointmentImages</strong>Â event (as well asÂ <strong>InitAppointmentDisplayText</strong>) can be raised fromÂ another thread than the one where the SchedulerControl instance was created. Accessing the SchedulerControl (SchedulerStorage) instance directly in theÂ InitAppointmentImages event when theÂ <strong>OptionsBehavior.UseAsyncMode</strong>Â property is true can result in "cross-thread" exceptions.<br><br>Correspondingly, to avoid theÂ "cross-thread" issues in a scenario when theÂ <strong>OptionsBehavior.UseAsyncMode</strong>Â property is true, you need to avoid direct accessing the SchedulerControl or SchedulerStorage instance in the mentioned event handlers.<br>To implement it, we recommend storingÂ all the required information to calculate custom appointment images and the display text as custom appointment fields, to operate only with the current appointment instance without accessing an underlying source object.<br>This example demonstrates how it can be achieved.</p>
